ARP- Address Resolutuon Protocol

If you know the ip address the mac address can be found through ARP

In ARP table ip address and mac address are stored. Constantly update

Network layer: Source(IP)-Destination(IP)-Payload
Data Link: S-D

If i dont know the mac address then i need to find the mac 
address which will be a arp event.

ARP event will always be within a single network.
Source would be mine ip address but destination would be switches mac address.

Whenevr a pc is connected arp event can take place

arp -a shows mac address connected
arp -d deletes

Logical Addresing

Classful Addressing: Divided into 5 classes: A-E
A-> [0_ _ _ _ _ _ _]. 2nd. 3rd. 4th-CIDR: /8 - (0 - 2^7-1)-Subnet mask would be 255.0.0.0
B-> [1 0 _ _ _ _ _ _.	].	.	-CIDR: /16- (128-191)
C-> [1 1 0 _ _ _ _ _.	.	].	- (192-223)
D-> 1 1 1 0 _ _ _ _.	.	.	- (224-239)
E-> 1 1 1 1 _ _ _ _.	.	.	- (240-255)

ABC was meant for normal uses and DE for special uses.
Network address- first address of the range, Broadcast address- last address of the range(if sent to this address then everyone will receive)
