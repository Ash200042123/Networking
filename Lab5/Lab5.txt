if network address is different then we need layer 3 device eg. router.

layer 2 device/router can only work with arp.

direct connection between switches wont work if they're different network.

port/interface

each interface in a router will have a different address.

broadcast domain

first valid host address will be the ip address of the interface/port.

? will show all available commands

first 2/3 letters then tab

en->conf t->int gig0/0/0->ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0->no shutdown

*show running-config, copy running-config startup-config
*show ip route

DC-DT cable. On one part clockspeed is set other part just follows it.

if we want to connect 2 routers then it has to be in same network

Routing can be set in two ways: Port address and ip address.

for default route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 (right-router ip address)
