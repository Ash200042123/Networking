Dynamic Routing Protocol:

RIP(Routing information protocol)

1)RIPv1-broadcast message to save info,
no VLSM(variable length subnet mask)(only network address is sent),
IPv4,no authentication
2)RIPv2-multicast address pair,VLSM,IPv4,authentication
3)RIPng(next gen)-multicast address pair,VLSM,IPv6,authentication

Frequence,distance affects routing

Metric: Hop Count(max hop count-15/16)
Timers: update timer(periodic 30s),invalid,hold down,flush

Split horizon(info wont be broadcasted to the source)
poison reverse(max dist would be broadcasted to the source)
